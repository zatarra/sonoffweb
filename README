This is a dirt cheap wifi enabled switch that you can use to turn on  all sorts of devices connected to mains AC.  Feel free to google it if you still have doubts.

# Ok, so what is this repo about?

This is a custom firmware that replaces the original one and provides you with a very simple  interface to turn on/off the relay. It gives you four endpoints:

- / `gets the current status of the relay`
- /enable `enable the relay`
- /disable `disable the relay`
- /toggle `toggle the relay on/off`

## Install

Please refer to this wonderful tutorial on how to upload firmware to the sonoff switch:
`http://captain-slow.dk/2016/05/22/replacing-the-itead-sonoff-firmware/`
TL;DR: You need to solder a pin header to access the VCC/GND/RX/TX pins and then you can use the esptool or the arduino IDE to push the code by pressing the reset button while connecting it to power.

##### DO NOT CONNECT THE SONOFF TO MAINS WHILE INTERFACING IT WITH YOUR COMPUTER JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.
